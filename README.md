# Architecture Gatekeeper

Architecture Gatekeeper supplies reusable mechanics for three semantic design
review stages:

- a fast, read-only local Codex hook;
- an explicit, on-demand manual architecture review;
- a higher-assurance pull-request review from a clean GitHub checkout.

The package does not define a repository's architecture. Every consumer owns
its authority list, reviewer prompt, decision schema, model selection and
target-branch CI policy. The runtime does not grant filesystem, publication,
deployment, credential or service authority.

Consumers may also own an optional decision-validation policy. The output
schema remains limited to the subset accepted by OpenAI Structured Outputs;
cross-field invariants are expressed as declarative `when`/`require` rules in a
separate committed JSON file. Each condition compares a JSON Pointer value to
an explicit JSON scalar (`string`, `number`, `boolean` or `null`); object and
array equality is intentionally outside this minimal contract. The shared
runtime evaluates only those declared path/value implications and does not
infer meaning from consumer fields.

When an authority is inside a Git submodule, the local runtime verifies it
against the parent revision's pinned gitlink. It never fetches a missing
component; unavailable pinned objects fail closed.

## Local integration

Install an exact release (or an exact Git commit during pre-release adoption),
then add a tiny launcher:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { runHookCli } from '@flair-agency/architecture-gatekeeper';
runHookCli();
```

The repository-owned `.codex/gatekeeper/config.json` identifies committed
inputs. See `examples/config.json`. Hook execution is network-free and invokes
an installed `codex` binary with hooks disabled and a read-only sandbox.
When `validationPath` is configured, the local and manual review paths apply
that committed policy after structured generation and fail closed on a rule
violation or malformed policy.

## Manual review

After installing a fixed package version, invoke the package-owned entrypoint
with the architecture question or proposed change:

```sh
architecture-review 'Should this responsibility move from Runtime to the Provider?'
```

The task may instead be supplied on standard input. The command uses the same
committed consumer-owned configuration, prompt, schema, reviewer settings and
authority files as the local gate. It emits the structured `PASS`, `BLOCK` or
`OWNER_DECISION` result with the reviewed Git revision. It does not reuse Hook
input, prior Hook context or CI policy, and it does not turn a decision into
repository acceptance or implementation authority.

## Codex Skill installation

The npm package distributes the runtime and command-line entrypoints only. The
explicit `$architecture-review` workflow is distributed separately from this
repository at `skills/architecture-review/`; install that directory through the
supported Codex Skill installation route and keep its revision aligned with the
runtime release you adopt. The Skill is a thin invocation workflow: the
version-pinned runtime, not the Skill, selects and validates repository-owned
authority.

## CI integration

Call the reusable workflow at the immutable commit that produced the reviewed
release, and pass only the two credentials declared by the workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  architecture-gate:
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    uses: flair-agency/architecture-gatekeeper/.github/workflows/architecture-gate.yml@<release-commit-sha>
    secrets:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      CI_SOURCE_READ_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CI_SOURCE_READ_TOKEN }}
```

The `actions: read` permission lets the reusable workflow verify the protected
owner-decision Environment; reusable workflows cannot elevate a caller's token
permissions. The caller keeps `.codex/gatekeeper/ci-policy.json`, its prompt and schema. CI
policy is read from the protected base revision, so a pull request cannot waive
its own review. `enforced` runs `openai/codex-action`; `local-only` records an
explicit waiver and makes no OpenAI API call.

To enforce consumer-owned cross-field invariants in CI, pass
`validation-path` to the reusable workflow. The file is always read from the
protected base revision. Validation runs with the called workflow's immutable
runtime after the model returns and before the review job can succeed; neither
the policy nor its evaluator executes pull-request code.

The workflow publishes the result as a GitHub Actions job summary and creates
or updates one marker-owned pull-request comment. The caller must grant
`pull-requests: write` as shown above. If the token is read-only, as it normally is for a
fork pull request, the job summary and authoritative `Architecture Gate / accept`
result remain available and comment delivery is reported as a warning. Do not
switch to `pull_request_target` merely to make comments writable while checking
out or executing pull-request code.

`OWNER_DECISION` is a protected human handoff, not a successful AI decision and
not a terminal deadlock. The reusable workflow waits for the fixed GitHub
Environment `architecture-owner-decision`. Before requesting approval it reads
the environment configuration through the GitHub API and fails closed unless at
least one required reviewer is configured and administrator bypass is disabled.
Approval is bound to the current workflow run, PR head SHA, and SHA-256 digest of
the structured AI decision. A new PR head cancels the pending run and requires a
new review and approval. `BLOCK` never enters this path and cannot be overridden
by the environment approval.

Each consumer repository that enables the handoff must create
`architecture-owner-decision`, configure the repository's accountable owner as
a required reviewer, disable administrator bypass, and permit self-review only
when the same owner may trigger and approve the workflow. A missing or weaker
environment leaves the authoritative `Architecture Gate / accept` check failed.

This repository dogfoods the reusable workflow through
`.github/workflows/self-architecture-gate.yml`. The `pull_request_target` caller
always comes from the protected base revision; it never runs a workflow supplied
by the pull request. Jobs that check out the pull-request merge revision have
only `contents: read`. The reporting job inherits `pull-requests: write`, but it
checks out only the called workflow's immutable source and never executes
pull-request code. The review prompt, output schema and CI policy are also read
from the protected base revision under `.codex/gatekeeper/`. This caller sets
`protected-review-instructions: true`; privileged triggers must enable that
input so a pull request cannot replace its own reviewer instructions. The
default remains `false` for compatibility with consumers that are still
bootstrapping their first base-owned prompt and schema.

Consequently, the first pull request that introduces this caller cannot execute
the self-review. After that bootstrap change is adopted, subsequent pull
requests exercise the real model review, job summary and sticky-comment path.

The reusable workflow uses GitHub.com's `job.workflow_repository`,
`job.workflow_sha` and `job.workflow_ref` identity properties to load and report
the exact called-workflow revision instead of code from the consumer checkout.
These properties are not available on GitHub Enterprise Server, which is not a
supported CI target for this workflow.

## Trust boundary

This is an architecture guardrail, not a tamper-resistant security boundary.
Local execution assumes a trusted Git executable, normal object resolution and
the same-user environment already trusted to run project hooks. CI relies on a
clean GitHub checkout. No review stage implements filesystem monitoring, path
leases, rollback, local object-store defense or malicious-operator resistance.
